I finally got my Tech. and am looking at these two models for my first HT. I\'m new at all this D-Star, APRS capabilities and was trying to get some insight from some fellow Hams. I like the IC-80AD RX range and Like the VX-8DR has more TX bands. \n\nSo basically if you had about 450.00 to spend what model would you choose?\n\n(I\'m open to other HT suggestions as well)\n\nThanks \n\n I finally got my Tech. and am looking at these two models for my first HT.
