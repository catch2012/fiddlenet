I\'ve started a warrior with some friends and I\'m going to be DPSing alongside them through 5-man randoms and a bit of questing ( but not much ).\n\nWhat spec should I roll?  Fury or Arms?  What tree should I follow?  What Classes (top 3) should I roll (Alliance)?  Professions?\n\nAlthough one other is a tank, I will have a tank offspec in case he can\'t make it one day... \n\n  I\'ve started a warrior with some friends and I\'m going to be DPSing alongside them through 5-man randoms and a bit of questing ( but not much ).\n\nWhat spec should I roll?
