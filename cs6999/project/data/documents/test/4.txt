Right, i\'m have weird feeling towards my best firend. It like I wan\'t her, i want to be able to hold her and tell her how much i like her. But the problem is she\'s homophobic. I feel like i should tell her, but i don\'t want to lose her friendship since we are quite close. the more time i spend with her, the more i want to kiss her, but most of the time there is just an awkward silence. When we sit there not talking, it makes me feel like.. It makes me want to tell her. But I can\'t. I don\'t know how to tell her, I don\'t know the right words. With all these feelings i get annoyed with myself.. so I self-harm. It\'s lead to me have depression. PLEASE HELP?? :wacko:  \n\n Right, i\'m have weird feeling towards my best firend.
