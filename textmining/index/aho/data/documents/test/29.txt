My first scanner from several years ago was (still have it) a Uniden BC72XLT. I got bit by the interesting things I could hear about the communities around me, and the information that helped me feel more a part of the community. Loved the way the scanner is so easy to use and program on the fly.\n\nRecently I was using the BC72XLT for some repeater scanning, and got to thinking about the service search capability. What are the frequency ranges (or discrete frequencies) that are pre-programmed for the ham, pol, fire, air and marine search bands? I know that there are probably 7 frequencies programmed for the wx (weather) bands - NOAA publishes these frequencies. What are the other ranges for the other service bands? I can guess what they may be for the ham (2, 6 and 10 meters), and the marine, but does anyone (maybe Upman) know where I can find documentation for these ranges that are preprogrammed in the scanner? \n\n My first scanner from several years ago was (still have it) a Uniden BC72XLT.
