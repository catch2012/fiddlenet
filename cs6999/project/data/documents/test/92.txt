I\'d never experienced it before, I\'m new to the MM scene, went from none to 3 in the last two months (and back to one).. \n\nIll start by saying I\'m not a \'play at the bridge guy\', I\'m used to Ps and Js and play off the front pickup.. My first and second MMs were both HH setups, never noticed this \'thin G\' phenomenon, my third MM was a single H Classic.\n\nPow.. thin G.\n\nSo, I tried playing forward, kinda went.. I\'m a hang off the pickup guy as well, so I tried my jazz off the bridge and my Les Paul bass off the bridge.. plinky thin Gs, I\'ll also add I play standing with a long strap and the bass neck angled up about 45\'.\n\nSo, neither of my HH\'s had it hanging off the front pup, but got plinky off the rear.. is it a matter of technique?, when the neck is angled up,  the bridge pickup is set fairly far back your fingers are angled back giving you less plucking force closer to the bridge and that far away?\n\nIs it an inherent design and ergonomics thing? I\'d be interested to know the opinion of guys who use a floating technique and play more around the \'middle\' like a P bass placment. \n\n I\'d never experienced it before, I\'m new to the MM scene, went from none to 3 in the last two months (and back to one).. \n\nIll start by saying I\'m not a \'play at the bridge guy\', I\'m used to Ps and Js and play off the front pickup..
