I have a Pro2096 and it was programmed to pick up all the local PD and the State Police. I pick up the State Police but really do not want to hear them.  I want to hear the local PD. I went on the reference guide and put in the frequencies for the St Clair County Simulcast (868.03750) and (868.45000) and all the number listed. I still get everything but I still do not hear the local PD.  Am I doing something wrong?\nthanks, \n\n I have a Pro2096 and it was programmed to pick up all the local PD and the State Police.
