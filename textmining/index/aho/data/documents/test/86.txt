He said she went into the  hospital 06 Jan., after experiencing shoulder pain.York had a long,  distinguished career on film, television, and on stage, but she is best  remembered for her early roles, when she had an immediate impact that  started with her 1963 role as Albert Finney\'s love interest in the  memorable period piece romp, \"Tom Jones\".With its tongue-in-cheek  sensuality, and gentle send-up of the British aristocracy, the film is  remembered as an early landmark in 1960s cinema, and York\'s unmistakable  presence added to its appeal.Her long blonde hair, stunning blue eyes,  and quick-witted repartee brought her a string of excellent roles.York  acted with major stars like Sean Connery, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon  Brando, George C. Scott, and many others, stirring some controversy with  her daring portrayal of a lesbian in the 1968 drama, \"The Killing of  Sister George\".In 1972, York won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.Her film work tailed off as London\'s \"Swinging Sixties\" era faded into  cultural history, but she returned to play Superman\'s mother.Actress  and politician, Glenda Jackson, who starred with York in the 1975 film  version of \"The Maids\", said York\'s death \"came as a shock\".Jackson said York had been a pleasure to work with and was \"too young to go\".York  branched out into television and stage work, earning a number of  accolades and awards throughout her long career.She made appearances in  several successful TV shows including \"The Love Boat\", in the U.S., and  \"Holby City\", in Britain.,Her stage work continued for much of her career, and included several one-woman shows.British  director, Richard Bracewell, who worked with York later in her career,  described her as \"electrifying\" once the cameras started to roll.Wells said his mother was incredibly versatile throughout her working life.\"There was the glamorous Hollywood aspect - she has worked with everyone from John Huston to Sydney Pollack - as well as the big commercial films, like Superman,\" he said.Wells, an accomplished television actor, said his mother also had a passion for writing.\"She wrote two children\'s books, which is great for her grandchildren, and something we will pass on to them,\" said Wells.York was born in London, and studied at the storied Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, which has tutored many of Britain\'s top actors, throughout the years.York  had two children - son Orlando, and daughter Sasha - with her husband,  Michael Wells, before they divorced.She is survived by her children and  several grandchildren.
