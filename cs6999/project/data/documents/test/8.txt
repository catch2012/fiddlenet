The core of the guild has been playing together for  roughly 4+ years, some even longer. The vast majority of the guild?s  members are college age, thus guild chat and Ventrilo tend to be fairly  graphic. If you have an issue with frequent profanity, then it is in  your best interest not to app to Void. We don\'t have the most serious  raiding environment when it comes to farm content and it can be very  laid back. However, you are expected to focus and concentrate when  needed during progression raids. Also, if you can?t handle what at times  may seem like harsh criticism, or tend to get extremely emo when  criticized, you also may not want to apply.\n\nVoid has been the top guild on the Mug\'thol server since the launch of  the Burning Crusade and that continues through Wrath of the Lich King.  Throughout TBC, WotLK and now into Cataclysm, Void is one of the top  raid DPS guilds. Although that may not seem like it means much to you it  does in fact show the dedication of our members in getting everything  out of their class and of course it validates their hard work.  Applicants will be expected to come in and immediately perform at the  same level as our members.\n\nBoss/Achievement History\nhttp://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/mug-thol/Void\n\nContact Information\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to message Bogus, Hyde,  Rothel, Visceron, or Hikoneky on Mug?thol.
