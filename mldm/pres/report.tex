\section*{Introduction}
Key to the field of machine learning is the ability to evaluate a
classifiers performance objectively and extrapolate performance
metrics to predict how a classifier will perform on a previously
unseen inputs. 

Few machine learning algorithms offer the luxury of being analytically
comprehensable e.g. Decision Trees. Such algorithms
allow researchers to analytically predict and compare classifier
performance. In most cases, however, researchers must rely on
empirical methods to evaluate machine learning algorithms. It is
important for the field in general to establish a well defined set of
methods for comparing machine learning methods. If researchers cannot
convince others that they have discovered a better algorithm, or do
convince others with unreliable evaluation techniques, the field risks
excusions down dead-end paths of research or abandonment of those to
potential breakthroughs. 

The ability to evaluate a classifier suitably is not
only important for comparing one classifier or one algorithm to
another but also in the generation classifiers themselves. In
principal, machine learning algorithms involve the search of a
\textit{hypothesis space} for an optimal target function that best
fits the training data. In many cases, this hypothesis space search
involves an explicit comparison of the performance of competing target
function candidates. The ability to pick the best candidate for the
job is at the heart of success, or failure, of a machine learning
algorithm. If such methods cannot converge on an optimal (local or
global) target function, their will be of limited utility in
practice.

In this paper we examine the prevalent evaluation metrics in use by
machine language researchers as well as their origins and shortcomings as
applied in the field. We track the development of new methods which,
in most cases, extend and complement exisiting. We identify domain
specific factors which effect different metrics and should be
considered when selecting a particular evaluation method. In
particular, we look at how the structure and composition of the
training set should effect the choice of evaluation methods.

Essentially any training set is a labelled sample drawn from a
probability distribution of possible instances in the problem
domain. If the set of possible instances is small enough to be
enumerated and labelled, the classification task becomes
trivial. Useful machine learning application are faced with...

While our discussion will deal with the evaluation of binary
classifiers, the same arguments apply in principal to multiclass
classifiers. In effect, any multiclass classifier can be reduced to a
binary classification problem by decomposition of the hypothesis. 


\section*{What's Wrong with Accuracy ?}
Accuracy is the simplest and most intuitive evalaution measure for
classifiers \cite{refworks:43}. Simply stated, accuracy, \(A\), is the
count of how many mistakes classification mistakes made over a finite
set of instances:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:accuracy}
A = \frac{t_p + t_n}{P + N}
\end{equation}

where \(t_p\) is the number of \textit{true positive} classifications
i.e. postitive training instances that were correctly classified as
positive; \(t_n\) is the number of \textit{true negative}
classifications i.e. negative training instances that were correctly
classified as such. \(P\) is the total number of positive training
example and \(N\) the total number of negative training examples.

Essentially any training set is a labelled sample drawn from a
probability distribution of possible instances in the problem
domain. If the set of possible instances is small enough to be
enumerated and labelled, the classification task becomes
trivial. Useful machine learning application are typically given a
sample of labelled instances from which to infer the probability
distribution of a large population. How representative
this sample is of the underlying population is key to how well our
classifiers can hope to perform classifying the rest of the instance
population. The structure of the training set effects different evaluation
metrics differently and, by implication, the target function upon
which they converge. It is important to analyse any evaluation method
in terms of its variability with respect to the structure of the
training set. Certain metrics will be better suited to certain
situations depending on the composition of the training set.

Accuracy does not distinguish the types of errors it makes (false
positives vs true negatives). While this is acceptable if the evaluation
data set contains as many examples of both classes (i.e. it is
balanced)...

\section*{The Confusion Matrix}
A useful contruct for comparing classifiers as well as comparing
different scalar classifier metrics, is the \textit{confusion
  matrix}. 

The \textit{confusion matrix} allows one to make 

\begin{table}
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}
    & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Actual} \\ \hline
    Predicted & + & - \\ \hline
    + & \(t_p\)           & \(f_p\)          \\ \hline
    - & \(f_n\)           & \(t_n\)          \\ \hline
    & \(P = t_n + f_n\) & \(N = f_p + t_n\) \\ \cline{2-3}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A confusion matrix. \(t_p\) = true positive count, \(f_n\)
  = false negative count, \(f_p\) = false positive count, and \(t_n\)
  is true negative count.}
  \label{tab:commandline}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Precision and Recall}

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:precision}
Precision = \frac{t_p}{t_p + f_p}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\label{equ:recall}
Recall = \frac{t_p}{t_p + f_n}
\end{equation}
