I have a 396XT that is acting up so much I\'m starting to think it\'s defective and it\'s becoming quite frustrating . Any advice would be appreciated before I send it off to Uniden for service.\n\nHere\'s the problem:\nI live in Wake County, NC monitoring the VIPER system. I programmed my radio using the latest version of Freescan, and I am confident that my configuration is correct (see below link). What is happening is that the scanner is stopping on channels where the traffic and TGID does not match what I programmed into the radio (in ID SCAN mode). For example, I programmed the radio for Wake Med with a TGID of 34592 but will hear Raleigh police with a TGID of 40112 (among others) on that channel. This is just an example; I will also hear Highway Patrol where I have RPD TGIDs programmed, Wake Med on RPD TGIDs, Rex on HP channels, Wake Med on Sheriff dispatch, etc.\n\nI understand that multi-select is being used with RPD dispatch and different TGIDs will show up on those channels. This is not what I am experiencing. I also understand that sometimes channels are linked when needed and can demonstrate this behavior. This is not what I am experiencing. I can also understand that sometimes anomalies can happen for this to occur. Again, I do not believe this to be the problem because it happens all the time I listen to the scanner. If this was considered &#34;normal&#34; I would have found a lot more data in researching the problem, so I do not think it is normal to the extent I am experiencing the issue.\n\nSome things I have done:\nMove the radio around in case of distortion, try different times of the day, etc.\nmade sure ID Scan is enabled, not ID search\nturned off/on Unit IDs\nMessed with audio types on the channels\nreprogrammed the radio from scratch using Freescan\nreflashed the radio back to 1.07; reprogrammed\nreflashed the radio back to the most current firmware; reprogrammed\ndisabled &#34;control channel only&#34; in Freescan and placed all the trunk freqs in the sites\nlowered the baud rate on the radio and com port to 9600 in case data was getting scrambled during transfer\nmonitored a single channel (instead of scanning) and experienced the same issue\nreset the scanner and reprogrammed\nprogrammed some systems in by hand\nmonitored scanning/TGIDs using Freescan to what was going on. I clearly see the scanner stopping where I have programmed a TGID 34593 with an alpha tag of &#34;Wake Med&#34; showing that TGI 40112 is what is being decoded and hearing police traffic on a hospital channel that should not be linked for any reason.\netc., etc.\nTried a sample Freescan config\nI have also researched these forums and others.\nStatus bit is not enabled\nI turned on the attenuator and that still did not help. The signal is so strong that I can even take off the antenna and receive a signal. Even with the antenna off (major attenuation) it still happens.\nI also monitored some of the trunk channels and I am not hearing anything that sounds like bleedover.\n\nI was not able to resolve the issue with any of these steps.\nI found some in the past who had these same issues with a different scanner and tried putting all the trunk freqs instead of just the CCs. As noted above, I tried that with no avail.\nI also read some that said this type of problem was normal for Uniden scanners. I question if it is normal to the degree I am experiencing the problem otherwise I think I would have found much more data on the problem.\n\nThanks for your time in reading this post. I would greatly appreciate any assistance with this. I would also like to know if you experienced this problem and sent it off to Uniden for repair and the outcome. BTW, I\'ve had this scanner for over a year and had this problem before. I thought I resolved it before, but it was not.\n\nHere are the links to my current Freescan config file and an Excel spreadsheet with about 1.5 hours of logging that shows what I am experiencing.\n\nConfig - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3825268/Fres...dio%20auto.996\nExcel Data - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3825268/Review_396xt.xls\n\nI also posted this in the Uniden forum a week ago or so. Unfortunately, no resolution was discovered. \n\n I have a 396XT that is acting up so much I\'m starting to think it\'s defective and it\'s becoming quite frustrating .
