\r\n The Hypocritical Civility of Power\r\nPosted by Shannon Love on January 16th, 2011 (All posts by Shannon Love)\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy is the left hypocritically pushing so hard for `civility\' in our political discourse? Why did they try to use the Tuscon shootings to suppress the passionate expression of non-leftists?\r\nI think the answer is simple: Passionate, sometimes even inflammatory, expression is the tool of the revolutionary not the establishment and today, leftists are the establishment.\r\nThose firmly established within the halls of power speak with calm gravitas because they have no need to stir people into action. Indeed, they wish the opposite, they want the people to slip into apathy so that those in power can govern as they wish. They do not have to motivate supporters with the hope of future benefits. Using the power of the state, they can provide their supporters with immediate real benefits.\r\nThose outside the halls of power need to stir people into action. They need people to rise out apathy and work hard for a change in power. Those outside the halls of power cannot immediately reward their supporters. They can only offer the hope of future benefits. They offer hope by using passionate rhetoric to paint an emotive vision of a better world. Passionate expression is the primary tool for those seeking to upset the establishment.\r\nForty years ago, the left were the outsiders seeking to impose a collectivist vision on America. Back then, the left supported all free speech no matter how extreme. They succeeded all too well and the leftist leaders of today were the vitriolic outsiders of the \'70s. Now that they are the establishment, they want everything cool and calm. They want the people passive.\r\nRight now, the Tea Party represents the uprising of the long-marginalized American middle class against the leftist establishment. The Tea Party uses the most impassioned expression today because they are the political outsiders. The Tea Party has to phrase its political discourse in intense and passionate terms because they must motivate the people to rise from apathy and take action.\r\nDon\'t fall for the left\'s hypocritical and opportunistic sudden discovery for the need for civil discourse. We live today in a looking-glass world in which those who call themselves `progressives\' fight for the past and established policies while those who call themselves `conservatives\' fight for the future and innovation.\r\nIf you are fighting for the future, be unashamedly passionate.\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n The Hypocritical Civility of Power\r\nPosted by Shannon Love on January 16th, 2011 (All posts by Shannon Love)\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy is the left hypocritically pushing so hard for `civility\' in our political discourse?
