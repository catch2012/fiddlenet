At church, I play my SR5 directly into the snake leading to the sound board.  I love the clean sound but miss the sustain and punchiness.\n\nCan anyone recommend a pedal or rack-mounted unit that can be used to simulate a good amp or to provide sustain and punchiness?\n\nThanks,\n\nbackagain1 \n\n At church, I play my SR5 directly into the snake leading to the sound board.
