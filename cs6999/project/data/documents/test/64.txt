What did I learn?\nI think my dog is going to do very well at it (sure- probably a very rookie feeling.) And I know she is going to love it based on her past experience.\nLike most competitve sports- there sure are cliques within the agility community.\nI was really bummed to see the average age of competitors (humans) to be well over 45ish, or very young- under 14ish. Mostly female, as well. Kinda sucks for me as a 28 yr old male.\nBorder Collies are FAST!!!!!!!!\nBorder Collies can be SCHIZO!!!!!!!\n\nFirst video- a VERY fast BC (who missed the contact on the AFrame, but the judge didn\'t call it):\nhttp://s113.photobucket.com/albums/n...current=bc.mp4\n\n\nSecond video- a VERY fast BC, who looses focus at the end, poor guy:\nhttp://s113.photobucket.com/albums/n...urrent=bc2.mp4\n\nEDIT- I guess I don\'t know how to embed video from photobucket. \n\n What did I learn?\nI think my dog is going to do very well at it (sure- probably a very rookie feeling.)
