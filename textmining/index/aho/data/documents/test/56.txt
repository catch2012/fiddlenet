Duke is a 5 yr old rescue GSD who\'s been in our home for 8 days. We have been using a lot of treats to reward him for sitting, and laying down, and staying, etc. We\'ve been trying to use them for &#34;trading&#34; to help with his resource guarding. The problem is this:\n \nDuke is very treat motivated, and gets very excited when he knows someone has a treat in their hand. He does pretty good if he knows you have a treat and you tell him to sit. He will willingly sit to get a treat. But if you hold the treat or especially walk away (for example if you\'re leading him to his crate) he will sniff your hands like crazy and jump. When we lead him to his crate with a treat he will willingly get in, and usually sit, but to get him to lay down is hard! He starts mouthing your hand and pawing you like you\'re asking him to &#34;shake&#34; (leaving scratch marks on your arms). Our &#34;trading games&#34; don\'t even work anymore because he smells the treats and will NOT focus on anything other than getting the treats...sticking his nose everywhere sniffing for the treats, jumping if you\'re standing up. &#34;Trading up&#34; doesn\'t really work if he\'s not interested in the toy to begin with. He\'s just overall very excited about treats and acts a little spastically.\n \nWhat can we do? \n\n Duke is a 5 yr old rescue GSD who\'s been in our home for 8 days.
