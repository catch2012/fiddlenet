Just wanted to introduce myself somewhat.  I\'m fairly new to the UHF world. I have been into to C.B. for around 15 or so years. I bought two iCom F24s and have programmed them to my Co. frequencies. This UHF seems like a totally different world so I\'m most likely going to be asking a lot of questions. :) so PLEASE bare with me.\nThanks,\n Bill. \n\n Just wanted to introduce myself somewhat.
