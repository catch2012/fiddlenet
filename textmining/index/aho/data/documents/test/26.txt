In view of the very worrying situation faced by Christian therapist Lesley Pilkington who was targeted&#160;in a &#39;sting&#39; operation by homosexual activist Patrick Strudwick, we are reposting this article, which is as relevant today as when it was written in 2001. \n By Christopher H. Rosik, Ph.D, NARTH \n The practice of conversion therapy involves psychological and/or pastoral intervention to promote change in the sexual orientation of homosexual men and women. Examining the history of the psychological and pastoral disciplines, it is only in the past few decades that the attempt to change unwanted homosexuality has been questioned. \n 	During this time, efforts to marginalize practitioners of conversion therapy within their professions have grown increasingly strident. Opponents not satisfied with the results of collegial reproach are attempting to add a new, more potentially devastating weapon: ethical censure. Particularly precedent-setting in this effort is the intent to consider conversion therapy unethical, even when freely sought by clients. If successful, such efforts could logically lead to these counselors losing their memberships in professional associations and being investigated by state licensing authorities. \n 	The intent of this article is to first outline the ethical complaints that have been leveled against conversion therapy, and then to describe several considerations which mandate a reevaluation of such concerns. Matters pertaining to risks associated with homosexual behavior, the possibility of change, and related treatment issues will be examined. A case study, which highlights some of these considerations, will also be presented. \n Read here \n  \n 	 \n &#160; \n In view of the very worrying situation faced by Christian therapist Lesley Pilkington who was targeted&#160;in a &#39;sting&#39; operation by homosexual activist Patrick Strudwick, we are reposting this article, which is as relevant today as when it was written in 2001. \n By Christopher H.
