# configure where output will go
# 'output' entry is a dict with 'init', 'config', 'final' or 'all'
# entries.  Each one defines where 
#  cloud-init, cloud-config, cloud-config-final or all output will go
# each entry in the dict can be a string, list or dict.
#  if it is a string, it refers to stdout and stderr
#  if it is a list, entry 0 is stdout, entry 1 is stderr
#  if it is a dict, it is expected to have 'output' and 'error' fields
# default is to write to console only
# the special entry "&1" for an error means "same location as stdout"
#  (Note, that '&1' has meaning in yaml, so it must be quoted)
