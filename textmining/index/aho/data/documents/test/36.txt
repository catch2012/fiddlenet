I was wondering if anyone has used these radios before. My wife and I are going to the Dayton Hamfest this year and want to use them just for my wife and I. We both have our ham license and I was going to use our  vhf.uhf portables when we are there. But the last time I was at the hamfest almost every frequency in the vhf/uhf side ws extremly busy and lots of bleedover due to being in close proximity with 20,000 other hams I also listen  to frs too but that was just as busy.\n\nAmazon.com: TriSquare eXRS TSX300-2VP 900MHz FHSS Digital Two-Way Radio (Charcoal Metallic/Black) (Pair): Electronics\n\nThanks\nMichael \n73s \n\n I was wondering if anyone has used these radios before.
