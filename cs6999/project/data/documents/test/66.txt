We\'ll Sonia is soon turning 6 months in couple days and I had her spayed on Friday(1-14-11).. I really couldn\'t have her go through her first heat process, because, She been going to a dog parks everyday, and K9 Academy classes.. \n\nDo you guys believe I made the right decision? my vet was even saying i should had done it as early as 5 1/2 months..\n\nalso, I have hard time giving her the pain medication, two pills every 12 hours.. but she doesn\'t show or seems to have any pain.. What should i do?   \n\nAnd Finally, How long should i wait to take her back to the dog park and her training classes..  she has the e-collar on to keep her away from licking her stomach, but she have it on till next weekend.. \n\n We\'ll Sonia is soon turning 6 months in couple days and I had her spayed on Friday(1-14-11)..
