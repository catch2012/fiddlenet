I have a HP Mini. My wife dropped it, and she was able to use it for a little bit. I then tried working with it and computer was unresponsive. I took battery out to reboot computer and now I am getting an error message after BIOS loads indicating it is missing Windows system file.\n\nGo into the BIOS and the hard drive test fails almost instantly. \n\nDo you think my hard drive is messed up or has windows been corrupted somewhow. \n\n
