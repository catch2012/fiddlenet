I\'ve been in scanning since the days of the Patrolman Pro-8, but I\'ve fallen out of the loop lately. My last main scanner purchases were the Pro-2035 and the AOR-8000.\n\nI thought about getting back into it again, but it appears that Yuma has gone completely digital (maybe even patrol encrypted), and I\'m getting conflicting information on whether or not they can be monitored.\n\nOne person says yes, and another says no, unless you go the the Police Department and get the codes, which I doubt they would readily hand out to anyone (though I\'m not really sure which codes were referenced).\n\nCan anyone tell me if there is a scanner that will receive both sides of a conversation, and can it be easily programmed? I\'ve thought about the HomePatrol-1, but I\'m not sure that would work. When it was originally listed, I think the web page indicated that it would receive Yuma Police. Since then, they list it, but not as a trunked system.  \n\nI\'ve scanned the forums, and other sites, but seem to get the same confusing answers, including frequencies that were active back in the 90\'s.\n\nExcuse the sounding rather naive, but there have been some major leaps-and-bounds since I last actively scanned anything.\n\nThanks in advance. \n\n I\'ve been in scanning since the days of the Patrolman Pro-8, but I\'ve fallen out of the loop lately.
