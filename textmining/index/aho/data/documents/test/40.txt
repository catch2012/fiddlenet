I was told today by a ham friend of mine that scanners are illegal in Alberta when used in a mobile environment. Apparently he was told this by a couple of sources including possibly the RCMP, and it may be in the Highway Traffic Act. Does any one know if this is the case ?\n\nThanks \n\n I was told today by a ham friend of mine that scanners are illegal in Alberta when used in a mobile environment.
