I have a pair of MA-COM Panther 500P Portable Radios. They are already programmed so all I need is a Downloadable Manual or instructions to do keypad functions. They each have Scan and Plus and Minus Buttons on the front and Tx and Receive and Function Buttons on L. Side and Emergency button on top. all I would like to know how to at least get them to scan the 16 channels.and maybe other keypad function. Any help?. Thanks. \n\n I have a pair of MA-COM Panther 500P Portable Radios. They are already programmed so all I need is a Downloadable Manual or instructions to do keypad functions.
