Hi! :)\n\nI have a Music Man Stingray 4 string bass with 5 tone/volume control knobs.  When I got it it came with a diagram of what they all do but have lost it.  I\'ve come onto the website to downlad another but am only able to find Stingrays with 3 or 4 controls.  Does anyone have any idea where I can find one please (or why my bass isn\'t on the website!)? :confused:\nThank you! \n\n Hi! :)\n\nI have a Music Man Stingray 4 string bass with 5 tone/volume control knobs.
