To pre-empt - I\'m looking for actual case law, etc.\n \nA scenario:\n \nA poster on GSD.com has posted that they take their dog into local stores that are not pet friendly, only service dog friendly, and marked as such. The poster admits the dog isn\'t a service dog, but does it anyway and lies to store employees and customers if questioned or looked at too hard. Someone that knows who this person and dog are and happens to frequent the same areas sees them in a store.\n \nLets make it a bit more interesting and say the person who sees them and knows they aren\'t a service team is with law enforcement.\n \nWhat, if anything, can be done? I understand the laws pertaining to questioning the average joe, but even with understanding that, I\'m not clear on the law here given that the person knows the dog isn\'t a service dog, and the person handling the dog isn\'t in need of a service dog by their own admission. Is there actual case law, can citations be issued, or is the worst that happens is that they are told to leave the store? \n\n To pre-empt - I\'m looking for actual case law, etc.\n \nA scenario:\n \nA poster on GSD.com has posted that they take their dog into local stores that are not pet friendly, only service dog friendly, and marked as such.
