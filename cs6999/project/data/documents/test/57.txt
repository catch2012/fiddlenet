Rumi will be 5 mths old on the Jan 24. Her front upper &#38; lower adult teeth started coming in around Christmas. Her upper canines are coming in &#38; she also has her puppy ones. Her lower canines have yet to show. The vet seems to think her adult teeth are probably slow to come in. But if the puppy teeth aren?t gone in another month she said they should probably be pulled o/w they?ll crowd the adult teeth. I was of the understanding that pups will have both sets of teeth for a bit &#38; the puppy teeth will fall out. Are pulling puppy teeth standard operating procedure in this situation? When should all the adult teeth be in? Is there anything I can do to get them to fall out naturally? Rumi does chew on marrow bones &#38; bully sticks but she isn?t the chewing machine I was expecting for the teething phase.  \n\n Rumi will be 5 mths old on the Jan 24.
