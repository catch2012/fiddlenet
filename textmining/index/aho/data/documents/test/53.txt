  A PRIMARY ANCESTOR IN MODERN ROCK MUSIC    \n We\'ll return this feature to its usual Saturday spot next week but felt like mixing it up\n For a lot of folks under the age of 30, Germany\'s Can are an unknown factor in rock\'s DNA.  Rules breakers, pioneer jammers and melders of disparate elements, Can whispers in the background of bands as diverse as Phish, Aphex Twin, Comets On Fire, Tricky and countless others.  One of the group\'s lead singers, Damo Suzuki, turns 60 today.  In honor of he and his former band\'s influence on modern music, we offer this small sampling of their work and blow him a birthday kiss.
