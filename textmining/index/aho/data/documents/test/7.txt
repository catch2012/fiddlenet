\r\n Oh boy. Via The Vancouver Sun, an AFP report: Ousted president Duvalier returning to Haiti: diplomat. Excerpt:\r\nHaitian former president Jean-Claude Duvalier, ousted from power by a popular revolt in the 1980s, is heading back to Haiti where he is expected to arrive later Sunday, a diplomatic source in Paris said. \r\n\"He is on board an Air France flight\" going to Port-au-Prince, the diplomat who requested anonymity told AFP. \r\nThe plane is scheduled to land in the Haitian capital around 5:30 pm (2230 GMT).\r\nThat\'s about 15 minutes from now (3:15 PST).\r\nUpdate (3:30 PST): #haiti and #babydoc are covering the return minute by minute. So is #jacquiecharles of the Miami Herald, who reports UN troops are now pepper-spraying the press at the airport.\r\n4:00 pm: HaitiLibre.com now has the story, in French and now English. Washington Post now has the AP report from Jacob Kushner. Ansel Hertz tweets Jen Pantaleon as saying the airport crowds are cheering for both Duvalier and Aristide.\r\n4:15 pm: Jean-Claude Duvalier and Baby Doc are trending on Twitter in Canada.\r\n4:25 pm: Story is on Le Nouvelliste (French only).\r\n4:30 pm: A flurry of tweets, too hard to sort out: Duvalier is still in the air terminal until police can arrange for his safety; media are jammed into a street or alley where they can\'t go forward or back; someone points out that the US State Department must have approved of Duvalier\'s return.\r\n4:40 pm: Duvalier\'s been sitting in immigration for an hour. (Photo)\r\n4:45 pm: The New York Times has the story.\r\n4:50 pm: Duvalier is in a motorcade leaving the airport.\r\n5:00 pm: Duvalier \"looks frail and sickly,\" according to Jacqueline Charles. Meanwhile, Ansel Herz says Ariustide\'s passport has also been renewed, and US Embassy spokesperson only knows what\'s on the radio.\r\nOK, folks, two hours of liveblogging Baby Doc is quite enough. It\'s fascinating to watch a story explode online, but I\'m going to take a break and come back later this evening. \r\n \r\n Oh boy.
