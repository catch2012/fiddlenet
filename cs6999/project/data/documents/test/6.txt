Well tonight I went out with some of my older friends who were racing. I\'m the youngest one and the lads are way too old for me (usually 17-19).\n \nBut tonight one of the lads bought his little brother who is 16. Things got a bit wild and, to cut a long story short, the 16 year old ended up fingering me in the back of his brothers car.\nPlease don\'t bother moaning at me for how stupid and slaggy it was. That\'s another moan for another day.\n \nAnyway the problem is that he now wants to go out with me, but I don\'t want any relationship at this moment.\nHow do I let him down easy so that he doesn\'t think i\'m a complete tart ????\n \nThanks in advance :) \n\n Well tonight I went out with some of my older friends who were racing.
