\section{Introduction}
Key to the field of machine learning is the ability to evaluate a
classifiers performance objectively and extrapolate performance
metrics to predict how a classifier will perform on a previously
unseen inputs. 

Few machine learning algorithms offer the luxury of being analytically
comprehensable e.g. Decision Trees. Such algorithms
allow researchers to analytically predict and compare classifier
performance. In most cases, however, researchers must rely on
empirical methods to evaluate machine learning algorithms. It is
important for the field in general to establish a well defined set of
methods for comparing machine learning methods. If researchers cannot
convince others that they have discovered a better algorithm, or do
convince others with unreliable evaluation techniques, the field risks
excusions down dead-end paths of research or abandonment of those to
potential breakthroughs. 

The ability to evaluate a classifier suitably is not
only important for comparing one classifier or one algorithm to
another but also in the generation classifiers themselves. In
principal, machine learning algorithms involve the search of a
\textit{hypothesis space} for an optimal target function that best
fits the training data. In many cases, this hypothesis space search
involves an explicit comparison of the performance of competing target
function candidates. The ability to pick the best candidate for the
job is at the heart of success, or failure, of a machine learning
algorithm. If such methods cannot converge on an optimal (local or
global) target function, their will be of limited utility in
practice.

In this paper we examine the prevalent evaluation metrics in use by
machine language researchers as well as their origins and shortcomings as
applied in the field. We track the development of new methods which,
in most cases, extend and complement exisiting. We identify domain
specific factors which effect different metrics and should be
considered when selecting a particular evaluation method. In
particular, we look at how the structure and composition of the
training set should effect the choice of evaluation methods.

Essentially any training set is a labelled sample drawn from a
probability distribution of possible instances in the problem
domain. If the set of possible instances is small enough to be
enumerated and labelled, the classification task becomes
trivial. Useful machine learning application are typically given a
sample of labelled instances from which to infer the probability
distribution of a large population. How representative
this sample is of the underlying population is key to how well our
classifiers can hope to perform classifying the rest of the instance
population. The structure of the training set effects different evaluation
metrics differently and, by implication, the target function upon
which they converge. It is important to analyse evaluation methods
in terms of their variability with respect to the structure of the
training set. Certain metrics will be better suited to certain
situations depending on the composition of the training set.

While our discussion will deal with the evaluation of binary
classifiers, the same arguments apply in principal to multiclass
classifiers. In effect, any multiclass classifier can be reduced to a
binary classification problem by decomposition of the hypothesis. 


\section{What's Wrong with Accuracy ?}
Accuracy is the simplest and most intuitive evalaution measure for
classifiers \cite{refworks:43}. Simply stated, accuracy, \(A\), is the
count of how many mistakes classification mistakes made over a finite
set of instances:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:accuracy}
A = \frac{t_p + t_n}{P + N}
\end{equation}

where \(t_p\) is the number of \textit{true positive} classifications
i.e. postitive training instances that were correctly classified as
positive; \(t_n\) is the number of \textit{true negative}
classifications i.e. negative training instances that were correctly
classified as such. \(P\) is the total number of positive training
example and \(N\) the total number of negative training examples.

Accuracy does not distinguish the types of errors it makes (false
positives vs true negatives). While this is acceptable if the evaluation
data set contains as many examples of both classes (i.e. it is
balanced), for most real-world problems one type of misclassification
error is much more expensive than another \cite{Refworks:45}. Accuracy
maximization also assumes that the class distribution is known for the
target environment. Without knowledge of target class distribution we
cannot be sure that we are actually maximizing accuracy for the
problem domain from which the data set was drawn \cite{RefWorks:45}.


\section{The Confusion Matrix}
The raw data produced by a classification scheme during testing are
counts of the correct and incorrect classifications from each
class. This information is normally displayed in a \textit{confusion
  matrix} showing the difference between the true and predicted
classes for a set of labelled examples as shown in Table
\ref{tab:confusionmatrix}. In Table \ref{tab:confusionmatrix}, \(t_p\)
and \(t_n\) are the number of true positives and true negatives
respectively. \(f_p\) and \(f_n\) are the number of false positives
and false negatives respectively. The row totals, \(C_p\) and \(C_n\),
are the number of predicted positive and negative examples, and the
column totals, \(P\) and \(N\), are the number of actual positive
and negative examples. Although the \textit{confusion matrix} shows
all of the information about the classifier's performance, more
meaningful measures can be extracted from it to illustrate certain
performance criteria. These measures, such as \textit{Accuracy},
\textit{Precision}, and \textit{Recall}, are described in detail in
subsequent sections.

    & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Actual} \\ \cline{1-3}

    - & \(F_n\)           & \(T_n\)           & \(C_n = F_n + T_n\)  \\ \hline
    & \(P = T_p + F_n\) & \(N = F_p + T_n\) \\ \cline{2-3}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A confusion matrix. \(T_p\) = true positive count, \(F_n\)

  negative count, \(C_p\) = predicted postive count, \(C_n\) =
  predicted negative count.}

\subsection{Precision and Recall}

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:precision}
Precision = \frac{t_p}{t_p + f_p}

\end{equation}

%----------------------------------------
\section{Non-Scalar Evaluation Methods}
The measures of performance dicussed so far are valid only for one
particular \textit{operating point}, an operating point normally being
chosen so as to minimize the \textit{probability of error}. However,
in general it is not misclasification rate we want to minimize, but
rather \textit{misclassification cost}. \textit{Misclassification
  cost} is usually defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:misclasscost}
Cost = F_p * {C_F}_p + F_n * {C_F}_n
\end{equation}

where \(F_p\) and \(F_n\) are the false postive and false negative
counts respectively, and \({C_F}_p\) and \({C_F}_n\) are the cost of a
false positive and false negative classification respectively. Class
imbalance and asymmetric misclassification costs are related. It has
been suggested that training
set imbalances may be addressed by training a cost sensitive classifier
with the misclassification cost of the minority class greater than
that of the majority class, and one way to make an algorithm cost
sensative is to synthetically imbalance the training set to reflect
the cost ratio \cite{RefWorks:52}. Unfortunately, little work has been
published on either problem \cite{RefWorks:61}.

The specification of a particular set of
misclassification costs or false and positive misclassifcation rates
define a particular \textit{operating point} of a classification system
Non-scalar evaluation methods try to characterize the performance of a
classifier over a range of operating conditions. Although this makes
direct performance comparisons ambiguous, we are more likely to be
able to select the classifier which will perform best in the real
world by applying domain expertise to the results of a non-scalar
evaluation which captures the performance of a classification system over a range
of \textit{operating points}. Despite the benefits of non-scalar
evaluation techniques, there is still a need for a single measure of
classifier performance that is invariant to the decision criteria, and
is easily extended to inlcude cost/benefit analysis
\cite{Refworks:32}. In some cases non-scalar evaluation techniques
have scalar derivatives which allow unqualifed comparison of
classifiers and qualitative comparison of variances between scalar and
non-scalar metrics.

There seems to be growing recognition in the field of the limitations
of scalar evaluation techniques and increased use and development of
non-scalar methods. Below we consider important non-scalar evalauation
techniques:

\subsection{ROC Curves}
The \textit{ROC} curve was first developed by electrical and radar
engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battle
fields and more recently, it has been employed in the medical decision
making community. In addition to being a useful performance graphing
method, \textit{ROC} curves exhibit useful properties that make them
especially useful for domains with skewed class distributions and
unequal classification cost errors \cite{Refworks:39}.

The curve is a plot of the \textit{sensitivity}, or \textit{true
  positive rate}, vs. \textit{false positive rate} (\(1 −
specificity\) or \(1 - true negative rate\)), for a binary classifier
system as its discrimination threshold is varied (each threshold
defines a classifier). The sample points obtained for various
discrimination thresholds are treated as points on a continuous curve
and normal curve fitting techniques applied. Together with the sample
points obtained during testing, the points \((0,0)\) and \((1,1\) are
included in the curve plot. The lower left point (\(0,0)\) represents
the strategy of never issuing a positive classification. The opposite
stategy of unconditional positive classification is represented by the
upper right hand point \((1,1)\). For classification algorithms which
do not use an explicit decision threshold, like Decision Trees, class
frequencies in the training set can be changed by under or
oversampling to simulate a change in class priors or misclassification
costs. 

\textit{ROC} curves have the attractive property of being invariant
in the face of class distribution changes. If the proportion of positive and
negative instances changes in a test set, the \textit{ROC} curve
remains the same. This is evident from the \textit{confusion matrix}
shown in Figure \ref{tab:confusionmatrix}. \textit{ROC} curves are
based on \textit{true positive rate} (\ref{equ:truepositiverate}) and
\textit{false postive rate} (\ref{equ:falsepositiverate}) which are
ratios, normalized for class distribution.

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:truepositiverate}
true postive rate = \frac{t_p}{t_p + f_n}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:falsepositiverate}
true negative rate = \frac{f_p}{t_n + f_p}
\end{equation}


Figure \ref{fig:roc} shows a sample
\textit{ROC} curve for a single classifier. The diagonal line between
\((0,0)\) and \((1,1\) represents the performance of a random
classifier which expoits no information in the training data. Any
classifier that produces a point below this line performs worse than
random guessing. Such a classifier is said to have useful infomation
but is applying it incorrectly and the sign of the classifier can be
negated to produce a useful \textit{operating point} \cite{Refworks:60}.

\subsection{Comparing Classifiers}
\textit{ROC} curves may be overlaid for comparison. One
point in the diagram is better than anther if it is above and to the left
i.e. has a higher true positive and a lower false positive
rate. Classifiers appearing on the left hand side of the graph near
the \(X\) axis, make positive
classifications only with strong evidence. Such classifiers make few
false positive errors but often have low true positive rates as
well. Classifiers on the upper right hand side of the graph make
positive classifications with weak evidence. Such classifiers will
classifiy nearly all positives correctly but will have a high false
positve rate \cite{Refworks:39}.

\textit{ROC} curves show the ability of a classifier to rank the
positive instances relative to the negative ones. The scores produced
by a \textit{probablistic} classifier are relative to other instances
only and not properly \textit{calibrated} as true probabilitues
are. For this reason, classifier scores should not be compared across
model classes and conparing model performance at a common theshold is
meaningless \cite{Refworks:39}.

\end{figure} 


\subsubsection{Iso-performance Lines}

\subsubsection{Area Under the \textit{ROC} Curve}
In order evalaute the \textit{ROC} curve as a whole i.e. extract a
single distinguishable scalar metric, the area under the \textit{ROC}
curve, \textit{AUC} seems to exhibit desirable
properties. \textit{AUC} represents the probability that a randomly
chosen positive example is correctly ranked with greater suspicion
than a randomly chosen negative example. \cite{Refworks:32} found good
agreement between \textit{accuracy} and \textit{AUC} with respect to
performance ranking as well as the following desirable properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item Increased sensitivity in the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests.
\item It is not dependent on the decision threshold chosen.
\item It is invariant to prior class probabilities.
\end{itemize}

% Statistical Techniques

\section{Statistical Techniques}
We assume that the true distribution of examples to which a classifier
will be applied is not known in advance. To make an informed choice,
performance must be estimated using the data available
\cite{RefWorks:45}. Application of statistical techniques is
becoming more widespread in the field of machine learning and serve to
rigorize the results of machine learning experimatation and bring it
in line with more established fields of diagnostics and
classification. Below we discuss some of the techniques employed in
machine learning evaluation papers:

\subsection{Sub-sampling}
Ultimately all machine learning evaluation techniques use a finite set
of training samples to project the performance characteristics of a
classifier over unseen data. It is known that single train and test
partitions are not reliable estimators of true error rate of a
classification scheme on a limited data set \cite{RefWorks:57}. In
addition to selecting an appropriate performance metric, it important
to employ some random sub-sampling scheme to minimize any estimation
bias. \textit{Cross-validation} is a common sub-sampling technique
used in machine learning evaluation.

Scalar metrics obtained from sub-sampling are easily combined into
means and standard deviations. Non-scalar metrics are not so easily
combined and the best method depends on the metric itself as well as
the specific goals of the study. During a
study by Bradley (\cite{RefWorks:32}) using \textit{ROC} curves, it was found
that averaging raw data (frequencies of true and false positives) from
\textit{cross-validation} to produce a \textit{pooled} plots,
depressed the combined index of accuracy, AUC. In the same study,
Bradley selected a technique known as \textit{pooling} to combine the
results of cross-validation to generate ROC curves. Foster et al
(\cite{RefWorks:45} used an alternative methodology, called
\textit{averaging}, after considering Bradley's methods inappropriate
for their requirements.

\subsection{Analysis of Variance}
ANOVA

\subsection{Bootstrapping}


\subsection{Confidence Intervals}
Even with the use of some subsampling technique, it is important to
quantify as far as possible the level of confidence that such
approximations offer in favouring one target function or classifier
over another.  We must be able to detect whether test results
indicating that one classifier is superior to another are
statisitaclly significant. 

A common technique used to describe the uncertainity associated with
an estimate is to use \textit{confidence interval} estimates.


%----------------------------------------
% Benchmark Data Sets
%----------------------------------------
\section{The Real World}
While the selection of appropriate metrics and statistical techniques
are important in evaluating and selecting classifiers, it is important
to remember that our application cannot be expected to perform well in
the real world if the training data does not adequately represent the
problem domain. Very few systems generated with machine learning have
been deployed and used in the field for a sizeable period of time
\cite{RefWorks:46}. Part of the reason for this is that the users of
the system and domain experts must be convinced that the system will
perform well with actual data. Real world data from the field can be
surprisingly dirty \cite{RefWorks:58} and historical data used for
training may have been cleaned. It is common practise to use benchmark
data sets like those collected in the Irvine repository
\cite{RefWorks:59} for performance evaluation of machine learning
algorithms. While this practice provides importatnt insights, it is
wrong to judge, on their basis, an algorithm's practical adequacy
\cite{RefWorks:46}.

Comprehensibility goes a long way to building confidence among
stakeholders of a classifiers capabilities, however as mentioned
previously, few machine learning models offer much in this respect.
