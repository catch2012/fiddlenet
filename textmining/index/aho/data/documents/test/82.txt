I ordered a Sterling 5 stringHH with a maple neck last year through my local Guitar Center. They were acually quite accomodating, in as much as I was able to get the pickups, neck and headstock the way I wanted it(Gloss Black with Maple neck HH pickups, and Gloss Black headstock). I should have remembered that my hands don\'t do well with maple fretboards, and the get dirty very fast. Also I like the tonal quality of rosewood or Ebony better. Is it possible to have Music Man refit my bass with the neck I want? or is it asking to much? If I cant get a neck for it I\'ll probably sell it, even though I love the bass itself. Suggestions? (I sent Music Man an email asking, but haven\'t had a resonse yet) Thanks, Ken \n\n I ordered a Sterling 5 stringHH with a maple neck last year through my local Guitar Center.
