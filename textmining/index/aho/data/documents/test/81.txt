Police recommend charges against RCMP officer after arrest caught on video...8 minutes ago  Enlarge PhotoAdam Cole, centre, shows his support, with about 200 others...         KELOWNA,  B.C. - An outside police force recommended an assault charge today,  against a British Columbia RCMP officer after a violent arrest caught on tape, announcing the decision about an hour before several  hundred people rallied against \"police brutality\" in Kelowna.[remember folks: no TAPE, no CHARGES! GRRRRRRRRRR]The  video, showing a Mountie kicking Buddy Tavares in the face, during an  arrest on 07 Jan., in Kelowna, has been fueling anti-police sentiment in  the city, prompting about 300 people to march from a local park to the  RCMP detachment this afternoon.Abbotsford police, which have  been investigating the arrest, took the unusual step of announcing their  recommendation before a report had been submitted to Crown counsel.Abbotsford Const. Ian MacDonald said the timing had nothing to do with today\'s rally.\"When  both the media and the general public came to be aware of a rally, that  probably would have been the best point in time to make the  announcement, if we were going to be guided by the rally or public  opinion,\" said MacDonald.MacDonald said Abbotsford police  investigators were finishing up their work in Kelowna, and the force  issued today\'s news release to pre-empt obvious questions from the  public when they returned to the Lower Mainland.He said police  had interviewed about 40 witnesses, and examined the video, which has  been widely broadcast, and viewed thousands of times, on YouTube.\"That  video was a very compelling piece of evidence, we used it regularly,\"  he said.\"But I don\'t want to discount the eye witnesses, either.\"We  were pleasantly surprised we had the full support of residents of  Kelowna.\"Crown counsel will have the final say on whether charges will be laid.Today\'s  protest was advertised on Facebook as a rally to \"stop police  brutality\". It lasted about 40 minutes and was peaceful, despite  warnings from the RCMP the demonstration could turn violent.\"People  are sick and tired of that type of thing going on,\" said organizer, John  Hewitson.\"People are sick and tired, and don\'t want to tolerate  police being paid while they\'re under investigation.\"While police  haven\'t named the Mountie involved, local media have widely reported Const. Geoff Mantler was suspended, with pay.Tavares made a  brief appearance at the rally.He said he\'s fortunate his arrest was  caught on tape, and called the experience \"mindboggling\".Tavares  was arrested on 07 Jan. after a complaint about shots fired at a  Kelowna-area golf course.Tavares has said his employer had asked him to  use the gun to scare off geese.A bystander\'s video of the arrest  shows Tavares, 51, getting out of his truck, with his hands in the air,  as both officers have their guns drawn, and then one officer kicks  Tavares in the face, as he is getting on the ground.When Tavares was released from custody, he had a black eye and several scrapes to his face.Tavares is on leave from his job at the golf course, while recovering from a brain injury suffered in a recent motorcycle crash.He has been charged with careless use of a firearm.The arrest has prompted angry complaints from Kelowna residents in blogs, online postings, and even to the Abbotsford police\'s tip line.The  RCMP called a news conference Saturday, asking the public to be  patient, as the investigation ran its course, and urging calm at today\'s  rally.Supt. Bill McKinnon said he was \"concerned\", after reading online postings urging civil disobedience during the rally.
