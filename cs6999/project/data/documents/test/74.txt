  \n  \n Eating  two handfuls of blueberries a week can slash the risk of developing  high blood pressure, which leads to strokes and heart disease, a new  research has found. \n   \n High blood pressure or hypertension affects at least 10 million people in Britain, reports express.co.uk. \n The latest findings show that bio-active compounds in blueberries &#8211; called anthocyanins &#8211; offer protection against hypertension. \n Compared  with people who did not eat blueberries, those eating at least one  serving a week &#8211; the equivalent of a couple of handfuls &#8211; reduced their  risk of developing the condition by 10 percent. \n The superfood has  already been found to fight hardening of the arteries, which can cause a  heart attack or stroke, as well as helping to guard against diseases  such as cancer and Alzheimer\'s. \n Anthocyanins belong to the  family of compounds called flavonoids and are also found in  blackcurrants, raspberries, aubergines and blood orange juice. \n The  research, carried out by the University of East Anglia and Harvard  University, is the first large study to investigate the effect of  different flavonoids on hypertension. \n The scientists studied  134,000 women and 47,000 men over a period of 14 years. None of the  participants had hypertension at the start of the study. \n Subjects  were asked to complete health questionnaires every two years and their  dietary intake was assessed every four years. Incidence of newly  diagnosed hypertension during the 14-year period was then related to  consumption of various flavonoids. \n During the study 35,000 participants developed hypertension. \n The  dietary information identified tea as the main contributor of  flavonoids, with apples, orange juice, blueberries, red wine and  strawberries also providing important amounts. \n Aedin Cassidy of  the University of East Anglia said: &#8220;Our findings are exciting and  suggest that an achievable dietary intake of anthocyanins may contribute  to the prevention of hypertension.&#8221; \n   \n  \n Eating  two handfuls of blueberries a week can slash the risk of developing  high blood pressure, which leads to strokes and heart disease, a new  research has found. \n   \n High blood pressure or hypertension affects at least 10 million people in Britain, reports express.co.uk. \n The latest findings show that bio-active compounds in blueberries &#8211; called anthocyanins &#8211; offer protection against hypertension. \n Compared  with people who did not eat blueberries, those eating at least one  serving a week &#8211; the equivalent of a couple of handfuls &#8211; reduced their  risk of developing the condition by 10 percent. \n The superfood has  already been found to fight hardening of the arteries, which can cause a  heart attack or stroke, as well as helping to guard against diseases  such as cancer and Alzheimer\'s. \n Anthocyanins belong to the  family of compounds called flavonoids and are also found in  blackcurrants, raspberries, aubergines and blood orange juice. \n The  research, carried out by the University of East Anglia and Harvard  University, is the first large study to investigate the effect of  different flavonoids on hypertension. \n The scientists studied  134,000 women and 47,000 men over a period of 14 years.
