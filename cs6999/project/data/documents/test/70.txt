Hey, Bill Belichick! Yogi Berra called! He said, \"It\'s over!\"   Jets 28, Cheatriots 21.  Gang Green have slain the big cheating New England dragon.   And they did it my way, as suggested in my previous post.  Which includes the 2007-08 Giants\' way: They got in the smug face of Tom Brady.  And the kicking game did make a difference, but not in the way I expected: The Pats tried 2 onside kicks late, but they both failed.  The first one, it was really sweet that it was Antonio Cromartie who recovered it to set up the last Jet score.  Cromartie being the one who called Brady an asshole.  Which... he is.   Big step up for Mark Sanchez.  Pinocchio, you\'re a real life Playoff quarterback now.   Big step up for Rex Ryan.  He can say whatever he wants now.  So can any of his players.   Biggest Jet win since... oh, January 12, 1969.  They are now 1 win away from the AFC Championship and a trip to Super Bowl XLV.   True, it\'s in Pittsburgh, and the Steelers have won 2 of the last 5 Super Bowls.  But, in the last 2 seasons, the Jets have won road Playoff games in Cincinnati, San Diego, Indianapolis and Greater Boston.  Who\'s to say they can\'t win one in Pittsburgh? (Troy Polamalu and Ben Roethlisberger, that\'s who, but they may not have as much say over this as they might think!)   Sometime this week, I want to do a post on \"biggest moments in the New York vs. New England sports rivalry.\" This was, easily, the biggest in football, even bigger than Super Bowl XLII -- for the simple reason that the Jets are in the same Division as the Pats and play them twice a season (3 times this season), while that is not true of the Giants.  The Giants cared less about messing up New England, and more about winning for New York.  They would have been just as happy to beat the San Diego Chargers, the team the Pats beat in that season\'s AFC Championship Game.   Is this the end of the line for the Belichick-Brady Patriots? Hardly.  Aside from Brady, they\'re really a young team, and they did win the Division.  Lest we forget, Brady is 33 years old.  That\'s not old for a quarterback.  Right, Brett Favre?   But if the Jets had shed some of their reasons to be afraid of the Pats before, they\'ve shredded the rest tonight.   *   The Jets move on to their 4th AFC Championship Game -- their 5th if you count the 1960s AFL as the direct ancestor of the AFC.  (There were previous American Football Leagues in 1926, 1936-37 and 1940-41.)   This will be the 15th AFC Championship Game appearance for the Steelers, breaking the record for AFL/AFC Championship Game appearances they jointly held with the Oakland (Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994) Raiders.  The Steelers were in the \"old NFL\" from 1933 to 1969, but never appeared in an NFL Championship Game until they started to be called \"Super Bowls.\" The Chargers have been in 9.  The Patriots, Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise have been in 8.  The Miami Dolphins have been in 7.  The Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts have been in 6 -- although that number rises to 10 if you count NFL Championship Games prior to the 1970 merger.  The Jets, as I said, are entering their 5th.  The Kansas City Chiefs have been in 4 (including 1 as the Dallas Texans).  The Cleveland Browns have been in 3 -- although that number rises to 14 if you count NFL Championship Game appearances (1950-69) and a whopping 18 if you count All-America Football Conference Game appearances (1946-49).  The Cincinnati Bengals and Baltimore Ravens have been in 2.  The Seattle Seahawks have been in 1 AFC and 1 NFC Title Game.  The Houston Texans, in 9 full seasons now, have not yet made the Playoffs.   Records in Conference Championship Games   Counting only NFL (1933-69), AFL (1960-69) or AFC (1970/71-2009/10).
