Drinks in the Trenta size will cost 50 cents more than similar Venti-sized iced drinks, the company said. Seattle-based Starbucks tested the new size in several U.S. markets  last year, saying it was responding to customer demand for larger cold  beverages. The Trenta size will debut in 14 states, including Virginia, Georgia,  Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona, on January 18 and in California on  February 1. The world\'s biggest coffee chain said unsweetened drinks in the new  size will have fewer than 90 calories and that sweetened versions will  have less than 230 calories. McDonald\'s Corp, the world\'s biggest fast-food restaurant chain, has taken direct aim at Starbucks with frappes, fruit smoothies and espresso drinks such as lattes and cappuccino.It also has lured customers by selling 32-ounce (946.4 ml) sweet tea drinks, for \$1 each. U.S. convenience stores, which have been taking on restaurant chains  with an expanded selection of low-cost, quick-serve fare, for years have  sold fountain drinks in large sizes, including 32 ounces and 64 ounces (1.9 L).
