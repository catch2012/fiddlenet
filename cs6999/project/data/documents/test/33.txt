So I purchased the Kenwood TH-F6A last week and played with it a little bit. I think I might have a little problem?!?!?!? I believe I will not be able to use it to communicate via the hamsats cross-band repeaters such as AO-51,AO-27,etc?!?!? I noticed that when I tried to enter the cross-band pair for the ISS station (145.800/437.800) it would not accept it. I looked at the owners manual again and saw that the receive &#38; transmit have to be on the same band?!?!?!? Well that sucks a bit. My Yaesu VX-5R can do it. I then figured that I could devote one channel for the uplink and 5 channels for the downlink (due to the dopplar effect), but realized that wouldn\'t work because I would need to be on the downlink frequency to have the squelch turned up but would also need to be on the uplink to transmit. I hope somebody can tell me that I\'m missing something!!!! If not than I will just have to use the VX-5R for the hamsat repeaters and use the TH-F6A for getting the telemetry (CW/SSW) sats. Oh by the way I have the Arrow antenna that I\'m using. \n\n So I purchased the Kenwood TH-F6A last week and played with it a little bit. I think I might have a little problem?!?!?!?
