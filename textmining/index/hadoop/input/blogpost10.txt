I have a HP Mini. My wife dropped it, and she was able to use it for a little bit. I then tried working with it and computer was unresponsive. I took battery out to reboot computer and now I am getting an error message after BIOS loads indicating it is missing Windows system file.\n\nGo into the BIOS and the hard drive test fails almost instantly. \n\nDo you think my hard drive is messed up or has windows been corrupted somewhow. \n\n 
Hi everyone, this is a great thread, I tried it on other forums and it was huge fun....\nHere\'s the idea :\nSomeone posts a picture which has something irregular or able to be captioned ridiculously (surely not a personal picture), then the next poster caption it in a funny way, and posts another picture to the poster below and so on...\nWhen I posted this thread on another forum, we had a lot of fun there, because there are really a lot of guys who can say comments which make others lol....\n\n\nSo, let\'s get started\nP.S. folks, try to be funny as much as you can....:D \n\n 
Right, unfortunatly, im a geek. I spend way too long on the computer everyday, i know about all the social problems which supposedly come with being a geek, but yeah thats not the point of this thread.\n\nSo, after spending long, long periods of time on the computer, when i stand up after about 4 steps by vision just blanks out, but i can usually just stand there, ive been told i look &#34;flushed&#34; when it happens. The most recent time this happened, i had to lean on the wall just to stand up. Any idea what this actual problem is? Is it normal after spending prolonged periods on a computer? \n\n 
Right, i\'m have weird feeling towards my best firend. It like I wan\'t her, i want to be able to hold her and tell her how much i like her. But the problem is she\'s homophobic. I feel like i should tell her, but i don\'t want to lose her friendship since we are quite close. the more time i spend with her, the more i want to kiss her, but most of the time there is just an awkward silence. When we sit there not talking, it makes me feel like.. It makes me want to tell her. But I can\'t. I don\'t know how to tell her, I don\'t know the right words. With all these feelings i get annoyed with myself.. so I self-harm. It\'s lead to me have depression. PLEASE HELP?? :wacko:  \n\n 
I listen to B105, our local radio station and about five minutes ago,  the radio station did a prank call.  They\'re done on regular basis, and  they\'re really funny!  The one that happened before, the dude from the  radio station called a liposuction place and requested a &#34;Gift Card&#34;.    The call-taker was laughing, and said you need to take them in for a  consultation.   Etc, etc. The lady then asked how old the &#34;women&#34; was.   He replied, &#34;my sisters two year old daughter&#34;.  He then said, &#34;I have  always wanted this as a little girl myself&#34;.  The call taker laughed  more, and said two is too young.  His like, &#34;why? She\'s fat&#34;.  Then she\'s  like you usually need to be above 20 before you\'re even considered.  He  replied, okay I\'ll call you back in 20 years then. \n\nRandom, but made me laugh.  Thought we should start a thread on funny prank calls ;) \n\n 
Well tonight I went out with some of my older friends who were racing. I\'m the youngest one and the lads are way too old for me (usually 17-19).\n \nBut tonight one of the lads bought his little brother who is 16. Things got a bit wild and, to cut a long story short, the 16 year old ended up fingering me in the back of his brothers car.\nPlease don\'t bother moaning at me for how stupid and slaggy it was. That\'s another moan for another day.\n \nAnyway the problem is that he now wants to go out with me, but I don\'t want any relationship at this moment.\nHow do I let him down easy so that he doesn\'t think i\'m a complete tart ????\n \nThanks in advance :) \n\n 
\r\n Oh boy. Via The Vancouver Sun, an AFP report: Ousted president Duvalier returning to Haiti: diplomat. Excerpt:\r\nHaitian former president Jean-Claude Duvalier, ousted from power by a popular revolt in the 1980s, is heading back to Haiti where he is expected to arrive later Sunday, a diplomatic source in Paris said. \r\n\"He is on board an Air France flight\" going to Port-au-Prince, the diplomat who requested anonymity told AFP. \r\nThe plane is scheduled to land in the Haitian capital around 5:30 pm (2230 GMT).\r\nThat\'s about 15 minutes from now (3:15 PST).\r\nUpdate (3:30 PST): #haiti and #babydoc are covering the return minute by minute. So is #jacquiecharles of the Miami Herald, who reports UN troops are now pepper-spraying the press at the airport.\r\n4:00 pm: HaitiLibre.com now has the story, in French and now English. Washington Post now has the AP report from Jacob Kushner. Ansel Hertz tweets Jen Pantaleon as saying the airport crowds are cheering for both Duvalier and Aristide.\r\n4:15 pm: Jean-Claude Duvalier and Baby Doc are trending on Twitter in Canada.\r\n4:25 pm: Story is on Le Nouvelliste (French only).\r\n4:30 pm: A flurry of tweets, too hard to sort out: Duvalier is still in the air terminal until police can arrange for his safety; media are jammed into a street or alley where they can\'t go forward or back; someone points out that the US State Department must have approved of Duvalier\'s return.\r\n4:40 pm: Duvalier\'s been sitting in immigration for an hour. (Photo)\r\n4:45 pm: The New York Times has the story.\r\n4:50 pm: Duvalier is in a motorcade leaving the airport.\r\n5:00 pm: Duvalier \"looks frail and sickly,\" according to Jacqueline Charles. Meanwhile, Ansel Herz says Ariustide\'s passport has also been renewed, and US Embassy spokesperson only knows what\'s on the radio.\r\nOK, folks, two hours of liveblogging Baby Doc is quite enough. It\'s fascinating to watch a story explode online, but I\'m going to take a break and come back later this evening. \r\n

We don\'t have the most serious  raiding environment when it comes to farm content and it can be very  laid back. However, you are expected to focus and concentrate when  needed during progression raids. Also, if you can?t handle what at times  may seem like harsh criticism, or tend to get extremely emo when  criticized, you also may not want to apply.\n\nVoid has been the top guild on the Mug\'thol server since the launch of  the Burning Crusade and that continues through Wrath of the Lich King.  Throughout TBC, WotLK and now into Cataclysm, Void is one of the top  raid DPS guilds.
