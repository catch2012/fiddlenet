I noticed on Oxford County Fire 154.070 agencies are coming across with a pl other than 192.8.  I know 154.070 just licensed as a repeater frequency ULS License - Public Safety Pool, Conventional License - WQMK711 - OXFORD, COUNTY OF - Frequencies Summary, I am wondering if each repeater site will have it\'s own PL so agencies don\'t have to monitor countywide traffic.  Anyone know? \n\n I noticed on Oxford County Fire 154.070 agencies are coming across with a pl other than 192.8.
