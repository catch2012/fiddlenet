Unknown Digital Signal on Motorola TRS TalkGroup\n\n\n\nI have been monitoring a trunked radio system in Alachua county Florida for a few years.  Every now and then an unknown TG keys up when Fire/Rescue is being dispatched on their dispatch TG.  Im assuming its some kind of paging data, but I cant pin it down.  (It only transmits when FR is dispatching)  I did some searching and listened to samples on this page:  Digital*Modes*Samples  I have come up empty so far.\n\nDoes anyone recognize this type of data?  Or maybe know of a few sites that have more samples.  (Most of the ones I have found were mostly HAM related) \n\n\n	  \n	 \n\n	\n\n	\n\n	\n\n	\n		\n			Attached Files\n			\n			\n	\n	Alachua County-15280.wav.zip (32.3 KB)\n\n			\n		\n	\n\n	 \n Unknown Digital Signal on Motorola TRS TalkGroup\n\n\n\nI have been monitoring a trunked radio system in Alachua county Florida for a few years.
