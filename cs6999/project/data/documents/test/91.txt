I\'ve been using the Ernie Ball 2810 Flatwound 5-String Bass Strings on my Stingray 5. I\'ve had the same set on my bass for more than a year. The intonation and sound do not seem to have degraded.\n\nDoes anyone else leave their EB flats on this long?\n\nThanks!\n\nbackagain1 \n\n I\'ve been using the Ernie Ball 2810 Flatwound 5-String Bass Strings on my Stingray 5.
