I listen to B105, our local radio station and about five minutes ago,  the radio station did a prank call.  They\'re done on regular basis, and  they\'re really funny!  The one that happened before, the dude from the  radio station called a liposuction place and requested a &#34;Gift Card&#34;.    The call-taker was laughing, and said you need to take them in for a  consultation.   Etc, etc. The lady then asked how old the &#34;women&#34; was.   He replied, &#34;my sisters two year old daughter&#34;.  He then said, &#34;I have  always wanted this as a little girl myself&#34;.  The call taker laughed  more, and said two is too young.  His like, &#34;why? She\'s fat&#34;.  Then she\'s  like you usually need to be above 20 before you\'re even considered.  He  replied, okay I\'ll call you back in 20 years then. \n\nRandom, but made me laugh.  Thought we should start a thread on funny prank calls ;) \n\n I listen to B105, our local radio station and about five minutes ago,  the radio station did a prank call.
