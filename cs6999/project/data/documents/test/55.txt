 \n The winners of the HFPA\'s 68th Annual Golden Globe Awards, the precursor to the Academy Awards, were announced tonight at an exciting ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton hotel. We will be updating this list below with all of the film-related winners once they\'re announced during the ceremony\'s live broadcast. It\'s very tough to root for any one film this year because there are a lot of good ones (just look at Best Drama - Black Swan, Inception, The King\'s Speech, The Social Network), but I\'m certainly curious to see who ends up winning. I\'m not expecting any major upsets, but you never with the HFPA. Read on for the 2011 results! \n The 68th Annual Golden Globes were held at The Beverly Hilton tonight hosted by Ricky Gervais. The full list of film only (no TV - sorry!) Globe winners can be found below.

DEMILLE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\n Robert De Niro \n What do you think of the winners so far? How is the ceremony going with Ricky Gervais hosting the second year in a row? Are the winners tonight an early indicator for the Oscars? What film(s) are you rooting for? \n Altogether not a bad year, honestly this was mostly what I expected, give or take Paul Giamatti winning for Best Actor and In a Better World for Best Foreign Film. Otherwise, I\'m happy to see David Fincher finally win and The Social Network take home so many awards, and I\'m especially excited for Natalie Portman and Colin Firth both win, as I wanted them to win the moment I stepped out of both of those films. So what do you think - will The King\'s Speech or The Social Network take the Oscar next? Is it \"Facebook\'s\" year to win? \n \n  \n   \n The winners of the HFPA\'s 68th Annual Golden Globe Awards, the precursor to the Academy Awards, were announced tonight at an exciting ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton hotel.
