hey all, I am in the process of purchasing my first house and I have some questions about antennas.\n\nI am looking to run a dual band ham radio, any one have any suggestions about antennas, brand, height etc... I am leaning toward the Comet GP series antenna, but not sure which one to buy, the heights range from 4\' 2&#34; up to 16\' 9&#34; tall, does height make a difference?\n\nI want to run a CB base station, any recommendations on antennas? Should the CB antenna be mounted away from the ham antenna?\n\nAlso, would having a scanner antenna mounted outside make a difference on the quality of reception? \n\n hey all, I am in the process of purchasing my first house and I have some questions about antennas.\n\nI am looking to run a dual band ham radio, any one have any suggestions about antennas, brand, height etc...
