Right, unfortunatly, im a geek. I spend way too long on the computer everyday, i know about all the social problems which supposedly come with being a geek, but yeah thats not the point of this thread.\n\nSo, after spending long, long periods of time on the computer, when i stand up after about 4 steps by vision just blanks out, but i can usually just stand there, ive been told i look &#34;flushed&#34; when it happens. The most recent time this happened, i had to lean on the wall just to stand up. Any idea what this actual problem is? Is it normal after spending prolonged periods on a computer? \n\n Right, unfortunatly, im a geek.
