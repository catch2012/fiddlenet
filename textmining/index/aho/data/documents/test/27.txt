Hey guys! I found this track recently:\n\nYouTube - Tom Ruijg - A Lie Has No Legs\n\nAnd I want more like it, I realize this is a recent release but I think its got a really good old school sorta feeling to it. I\'d really like to find tracks that would go well with this one for some good old school house sets. Any recommendations welcome! \n\n Hey guys!
