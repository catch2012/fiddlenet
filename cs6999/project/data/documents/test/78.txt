  \n  \n Marilyn  Monroe looks set to make a screen comeback from beyond the grave after  the rights to her image were taken up by a branding expert. \n   \n Jamie  Salter plans to use high-tech imaging technology to revive the tragic  actress on the big screen after purchasing her &#8220;name and likeness&#8221; in a  multi-million pound deal last week, reports dailystar.co.uk. \n Salter  bought the rights from Anna Strasberg, whose late husband, actor Lee  Strasberg, was Monroe\'s acting teacher and beneficiary of her will. The  exact sum he paid has not been disclosed. \n Salter, who also  manages Bob Marley\'s image through his firm, is convinced he can make  the &#8220;Some Like It Hot&#8221; star more popular than ever. \n &#8220;Why does  Lindsay Lohan aspire to be Marilyn Monroe? Why does Lady Gaga aspire to  be Marilyn Monroe? The reason is that she is an iconic personality, she  has great style, she is just simply elegant. She stands for glamour, and  sex appeal, and remember this, she proves that size doesn\'t matter. She  is voluptuous, a real woman,&#8221; said Salter. \n &#8220;The younger generation will fall in love with her the way we fell in love,&#8221; he added. \n   \n  \n Marilyn  Monroe looks set to make a screen comeback from beyond the grave after  the rights to her image were taken up by a branding expert. \n   \n Jamie  Salter plans to use high-tech imaging technology to revive the tragic  actress on the big screen after purchasing her &#8220;name and likeness&#8221; in a  multi-million pound deal last week, reports dailystar.co.uk. \n Salter  bought the rights from Anna Strasberg, whose late husband, actor Lee  Strasberg, was Monroe\'s acting teacher and beneficiary of her will.
