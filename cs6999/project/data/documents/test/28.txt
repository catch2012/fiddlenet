Hi Guys,\n\nI have been using a neat database prog with my WinRadio G303e called (strangely enough!) &#34;Radio DataBase Manager XRS v6.1&#34; by Victor Fonseca for a couple of years and it works very well - but the data itself needs updating and it\'s not conventional or easily crossed-over from Eibi or anything.\n\nI tried to find his website and googled for it but no joy - it\'s gone!\n\nIf anyone has ant idea where he\'s gone, I\'d be very grateful - thanks.\n\nMartin. \n\n Hi Guys,\n\nI have been using a neat database prog with my WinRadio G303e called (strangely enough!) &#34;Radio DataBase Manager XRS v6.1&#34; by Victor Fonseca for a couple of years and it works very well - but the data itself needs updating and it\'s not conventional or easily crossed-over from Eibi or anything.\n\nI tried to find his website and googled for it but no joy - it\'s gone!\n\nIf anyone has ant idea where he\'s gone, I\'d be very grateful - thanks.\n\nMartin. \n\n
