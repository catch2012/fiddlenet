Hello,\n\nI recently acquired a great Silhouette from a forumite (thanks Dave!) and I love the way it plays but am thinking about putting some higher output pickups in the guitar (something I have never experimented with).  \n\nI am thinking about keeping the middle single and using the Petrucci combo for the bridge and neck so I can keep the 5 way switching with the strat like tones in 2 and 4.\n\nFirst, has anyone tried this combo in a Silhouette?  I am wondering how it works with the alder body as opposed to the basswood of the Petrucci.  Also, do I need standard or F spaced?\n\nThanks a million!\n\nJason \n\n Hello,\n\nI recently acquired a great Silhouette from a forumite (thanks Dave!) and I love the way it plays but am thinking about putting some higher output pickups in the guitar (something I have never experimented with).  \n\nI am thinking about keeping the middle single and using the Petrucci combo for the bridge and neck so I can keep the 5 way switching with the strat like tones in 2 and 4.\n\nFirst, has anyone tried this combo in a Silhouette?
